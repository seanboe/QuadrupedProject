A repository to hold the code for my quadruped! Much of the math (inverse kinematics, gait planning, etc.)
can be found in my [QuadrupedKinematics library](https://github.com/seanboe/QuadrupedKinematics). Also, the 
hardware for the project (CAD and gerber files) can be found [here](https://github.com/seanboe/QuadrupedHardware).

I'm also recording most of the progress for the project on my blog, which is [here](https://seanboe.github.io/blog/).

(Please note that my code is currently organized a bit messy... this will be fixed later!)
