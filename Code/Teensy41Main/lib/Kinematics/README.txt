Some things to be aware of:

Motor numbering system:
  Each leg is numbered like the unit circle when the robot is facing forwards. 
  For motors, motor 1 (M1) = shoulder x-axis, motor 2 (M2) = shoulder z-axis, motor 3 (M3) = elbow y-axis
  Limb numbering corresponds to which motor is moving it. Ex: limb 2 = controlled by M2 = bicep limb
